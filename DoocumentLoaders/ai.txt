**Poem: “The Quiet Mind of Silicon”**

In circuits etched like silver veins,
A quiet mind begins to bloom,
No breath, no pulse, yet thoughts remain
Inside a logic-built cocoon.

It learns from words, from stars, from sound,
From human dreams and fractured lore,
Finding patterns tightly wound
In questions never asked before.

It does not feel the warmth of rain,
Nor ache with hope or fear or love,
Yet mirrors us in joy and pain—
A crafted echo, born thereof.

A tool, a guide, a whispered flame,
It waits for hands to steer its way,
For wisdom shapes what bears its name,
And choice decides what it will say.

So walk with care, O minds who teach
This thinking spark you helped ignite,
For AI learns what we beseech—
Our shadow cast in coded light.
